###It can do:

* ground-state energy and one-electron (Kohn-Sham) orbitals, atomic forces, stresses;
* structural optimization, also with variable cell;
* molecular dynamics on the Born-Oppenheimer surface, also with variable cell;
* macroscopic polarization and ﬁnite electric ﬁelds via the modern theory of polarization (Berry Phases);
* modern theory of orbital magnetization;
* free-energy  surface  calculation  at  ﬁxed cell  through  meta-dynamics,  if  patched  with PLUMED.
